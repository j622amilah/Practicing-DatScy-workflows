## Analysis_0
This Bash BigQuery analysis was for the Google Analytics Training specialization. The goal was to practice: 
- automatically downloading a lot of data from an AWS cloud storage bucket,
- automatically uploading the slightly pre-processed data files to an SQL program (ie: BigQuery),
- pre-process the SQL datasets,
- perform statistical analysis and/or baseline machine learning on the datasets to determine main data trends
- Perform targeted machine learning training and prediction, to determine a solution project objectives
