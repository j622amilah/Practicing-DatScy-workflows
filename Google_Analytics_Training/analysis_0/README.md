# google_analytics_training_bikeshare_data

This Bash BigQuery analysis was for the Google Analytics Training specialization. The goal was to practice: 
- automatically downloading a lot of data from a cloud storage bucket,
- automatically uploading the slightly pre-processed data files to an SQL program (ie: BigQuery),
- pre-process the SQL datasets,
- perform statistical analysis and/or baseline machine learning on the datasets to determine main data trends
- Perform targeted machine learning training and prediction, to determine a solution project objectives

## Fictional project objective scenario 
The fictional project objective of this analysis was to understand how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes diï¬€erently, and then predict membership using key features from the Cyclistic data at an accuracy of 95% or better; 78 datasets were downloaded from a public AWS bucket and 64 datasets were ingested into GCP using a bash/GCP script.
